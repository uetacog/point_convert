I have alwasy wanted a point tool like this. I finally had some free time and made my own.

It is used for reference only, don't use it to map a life and death trip off the map.

`pip install mgrs` is required for the mgrs support

The package compiles nicely with pyinstaller, I plan to add those packages some day.
